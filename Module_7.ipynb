        "# 1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        " Interpreted languages are executed line by line at runtime (e.g., Python), whereas compiled languages are transformed into machine code before execution (e.g., C++) for faster performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        " Exception handling in Python allows a program to continue execution or handle errors gracefully using try, except, else, and finally blocks.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        " The finally block is executed regardless of whether an exception occurs or not, and is often used for cleanup actions like closing files.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        " Logging is a way to track events that happen during program execution. It helps in debugging, monitoring, and auditing software behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        " The __del__ method is called when an object is about to be destroyed and can be used to release resources like files or network connections.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        " `import module` loads the entire module. `from module import something` loads only specific functions, classes, or variables from the module.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        " You can handle multiple exceptions by writing multiple except blocks or using a tuple of exceptions in a single except block.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        " The with statement ensures proper acquisition and release of file resources, automatically closing the file after the block is executed.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        " Multithreading uses multiple threads within a process; multiprocessing uses separate processes. Multiprocessing avoids GIL issues in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        " Logging provides persistent diagnostic information, is more flexible than print statements, and supports multiple levels of severity.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
        " Memory management involves allocating, using, and releasing memory during the program lifecycle. Python handles this using a private heap and garbage collection.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        " Use try to wrap risky code, except to handle specific errors, else for code after try if no exception occurs, and finally for cleanup actions.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        " Good memory management prevents memory leaks, improves performance, and ensures that applications run efficiently and reliably.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        " The try block contains code that may raise an exception. The except block handles the exception if one occurs, preventing program crash.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        " Python uses reference counting and a cyclic garbage collector to reclaim memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        " The else block runs if no exception occurs in the try block, separating normal code from exception-handling code.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        " DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL are the common logging levels, indicating increasing severity.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
        " os.fork() is Unix-specific and creates a child process. The multiprocessing module is cross-platform and provides a simpler interface for parallelism.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        " Closing a file releases system resources, ensures all data is written properly, and prevents file corruption.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
        " file.read() reads the entire file into a single string. file.readline() reads one line at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 21. What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
        " The logging module is used to log messages to different destinations (console, file, etc.) with different severity levels.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
        " The os module allows you to interact with the operating system, including file path manipulation, file deletion, and directory navigation.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
        " Circular references, memory leaks from long-lived objects, and handling large datasets can complicate memory management in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n",
        " You can raise an exception using the raise keyword: `raise ValueError(\"Custom error message\")`.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
        " Multithreading is useful for I/O-bound tasks, allowing applications to remain responsive and efficient by performing tasks concurrently.\n"
